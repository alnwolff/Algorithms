# Algorithm Training

### Trainings from [Code Wars](https://www.codewars.com/users/Alan%20Sanchez)

#### This is the repository where I save my trainings and improve my problem-solving skills

**You will find at least two solutions for each problem**
- Solution
- Optimized Solution

**Solution** <br />
This is the solution I gave to the problem first. The one I crafted from scratch and sometimes it might not be the most optimal solution.

**Optimized Solution** <br />
This is my conclusion after checking it with peers and different ways to solve the algorithms.
